BI Engineer at Wavicle Data Solutions. Joined Wavicle to work as a R/R Shiny Developer for a large modeling project. Also enjoy coding in Python and expanding my knowledge of cloud architecture. I'm happiest at work when I spend time figuring out elegant solutions to technical problems.

My background is environmental sciences / renewable energy / spatial data modeling. I most recently worked in energy efficiency consulting where I interacted with energy data with various tools.

I'm most excited by learning and building new things. I enjoy working with raspberry pis in my free time and creating things with hardware as opposed to software.

Outside of work I am also a dad, which takes up much of my free time. I like to ride my bike through the city streets whenever I can.

I hold a bachelor’s degree in natural resources from Oregon State University and a master’s degree in environmental sciences and management from Humboldt State University as well as a graduate certificate in GIS from Portland State University.
