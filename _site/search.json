It can also be used to select and change node elements in a webpage. Additionally, there is an R package, R2D3 that allows for D3 code to be run easily in Shiny.\nThis workflow was adapted from an HTML implementation of D3 on an old website I made. I wanted to reuse some of the code because I like the effect that it makes and adapt it to run in R and Shiny.\n\nLoad Libraries\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(r2d3)\n\n\nCreate Simple Shiny App\nNote that Shiny doesn’t run in static R markdown documents! We are just using shiny as a way to generate HTML code, hence no server function. The D3 code then interacts as javascript the rendered HTML page and we can see the effects.  The JS code is captured in a separate script that is shown below.\nfluidPage(\n  r2d3(script = \"www/d3.js\", height = 0),# important to set the height of the D3 script\n  tags$div(style = \"background-color: red; height: 200px\",\n           id = \"one\",\n           \"Initial Div\"),\n  tags$div(style = \"height: 0px; opacity: 0; background-color: lightblue\",\n           id = \"two\",\n           \"Next Div\"),\n  actionButton(\"btn-one\", \"Change Div\", class = \"btn\"),\n  actionButton(\"btn-two\", \"Change Div Back\")\n)\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"data\":null,\"type\":\"NULL\",\"container\":\"svg\",\"options\":null,\"script\":\"var d3Script = function(d3, r2d3, data, svg, width, height, options, theme, console) {\\nthis.d3 = d3;\\n\\nsvg = d3.select(svg.node());\\n/* R2D3 Source File:  www/d3.js */\\n\\n// define height of original div\\nvar h = d3.select(\\\"#one\\\").node().getBoundingClientRect().height;\\nvar trans = 1000; // define transition time\\n\\n// select first div element and make it disappear\\nd3.select('#btn-one').on(\\\"click\\\", () => {\\n\\t\\td3.select('#one').transition().\\n\\t\\tduration(trans).\\n\\t\\tstyle(\\\"height\\\", 0 + 'px')\\n\\t\\t.style(\\\"opacity\\\", 0);\\n\\t\\t\\n// Select other div and replace \\n\\t\\td3.select('#two').\\n\\t\\ttransition().\\n\\t\\tduration(trans).\\n\\t\\tstyle(\\\"height\\\", h + 'px').\\n\\t\\tstyle(\\\"opacity\\\", 1);\\n});\\n\\n// repeat same operation in reverse order\\nd3.select('#btn-two').on(\\\"click\\\", () => {\\n\\t\\td3.select('#one').\\n\\t\\ttransition().\\n\\t\\tduration(trans).\\n\\t\\tstyle(\\\"height\\\", h + 'px')\\n\\t\\t.style(\\\"opacity\\\", 1);\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\td3.select('#two').\\n\\t\\ttransition().\\n\\t\\tduration(trans).\\n\\t\\tstyle(\\\"height\\\", 0 + 'px').\\n\\t\\tstyle(\\\"opacity\\\", 0);\\n});\\n};\",\"style\":null,\"version\":6,\"theme\":{\"default\":{\"background\":\"#FFFFFF\",\"foreground\":\"#000000\"},\"runtime\":{\"background\":\"#FFFFFF\",\"foreground\":\"#000000\"}},\"useShadow\":true},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}Initial Div\nNext Div\nChange Div\nChange Div Back\n\nWhile the same effect could be achieved with jquery or plain JS it was fun to come up with a usage for D3 that integrates into R Markdown so well.\nContents of d3.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// add bootstrap table styles to pandoc tables\nfunction bootstrapStylePandocTables() {\n  $('tr.odd').parent('tbody').parent('table').addClass('table table-condensed');\n}\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  bootstrapStylePandocTables();\n});\n\n\n\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  window.buildTabsets(\"TOC\");\n});\n\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  $('.tabset-dropdown > .nav-tabs > li').click(function () {\n    $(this).parent().toggleClass('nav-tabs-open');\n  });\n});\n\n  (function () {\n    var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n    script.type = \"text/javascript\";\n    script.src  = \"https://mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML\";\n    document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(script);\n  })();\n",
