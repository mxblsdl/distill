> I decided to tear down this server since I thought it's functionality had expired for me. This was a really great project for personal development and interest, but I no longer wanted to maintain it and pay for the server.

As an R user who also became interested in web development, I naturally gravitated towards R Shiny. I set up my own Shiny Server where I am able to make hobby apps or test proof of concept ideas. Many of the apps never really get *finished*, but for me the creation and problem solving aspect is the most enjoyable part. 

My Shiny Server is hosted on a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) VM. Setting this up and maintaining the server was a great learning experience in itself and showed me the power of what a minimal cloud server can do.

I run DO's lowest power option for $5 a month which is plenty for hosting Shiny Server as well as a couple of databases. In a world of managed cloud computing options its nice to know I am able to set up and run projects with only a linux terminal.
